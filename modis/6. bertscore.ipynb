First, the RGB image (left) shows extensive, uniform surface obscuration. The purple dot is the location. So in RGB, the uniform dark areas with patches of lighter cloud-like features—probably stratus or low stratus clouds because they\\'re uniform and cover a large area. The texture is smooth, not convective, so low-level moisture and stable conditions.\\n\\nThen LST/IR (right) is greenish, which in IR, green often means lower temperatures (since IR is thermal, warmer is darker, but wait, LST is land surface temperature. Wait, the LST image here—green might indicate cool temperatures. But the key is the surface obscuration in RGB is likely cloud cover. In IR, the cloud top temperature would be cold, but the LST is surface temp. Wait, but the question is about surface obscuration, so the RGB shows clouds covering the surface. So the LST image would show the surface temperature beneath the clouds, but if the clouds are thick, the LST might be masked. But the key is the uniformity in RGB suggests low stratus, which is common in stable conditions like coastal fog or stratus from maritime cold air advection.\\n\\nSynthesis: The RGB\\'s uniform, extensive obscuration indicates persistent low stratus clouds, typical of stable atmospheric conditions with moisture advection (e.g., maritime cold air advection over warmer land or sea, or coastal fog). The LST/IR\\'s cool surface signatures (green) align with cloud-induced cooling, confirming persistent cloud cover. Thus, the mechanism is likely maritime stratus formation due to stable, moist air with weak vertical motion, persisting into mid-morning as the sun rises but clouds remain thick.\\n\\nWait, need to check the images. The RGB left: dark areas with some white patches, but the purple dot is on a dark area, so maybe the surface is obscured by clouds. The LST right: green, which in LST, green might be cooler surface temps, but if there\\'s cloud cover, the LST is masked. But the question is about the obscuration in RGB, which is the surface covered by clouds. So the meteorological mechanism is low stratus, which is stable, so no convection, persistent.\\n\\nSo step 1: RGB has uniform, extensive cloud cover with smooth texture (stratus), indicating low-level moisture and stability.\\n\\nStep 2: LST/IR shows cool surface temperatures (green), consistent with cloud cover blocking solar heating, so the obscuration is persistent.\\n\\nStep 3: Combining, the uniform stratus in RGB (stable, moist air) explains the persistent surface obscuration, with LST confirming cloud cover via cool surface temps.\\n\\nNow, structure: 4-6 sentences.\\n\\n1.

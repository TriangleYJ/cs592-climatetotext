A broad region of moderate positive SBCAPE, primarily shaded in light to dark blue corresponding to values generally above $100 \\text{ J/kg}$, extends across the central and eastern United States, coinciding with low SBCIN values across the Ohio Valley and Southeast. Specifically, weak SBCIN contours (e.g., $25 \\text{ J/kg}$) bracket the area where moderate instability is noted near southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. This overlap of low inhibition and available Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) provides the necessary thermodynamic ingredient for isolated storm formation in the specified region.",

However, a severe thunderstorm watch will be considered if more widespread storm coverage is expected. The threat for severe weather is expected to remain isolated and a watch is not currently anticipated.",

      "caption_gt": "This figure displays the Freezing Level Height in kilofeet (kft) via purple contours and relative humidity (RH) in the boundary layer via color fill. A complex pattern exists where pockets of high RH (green fill) coincide with lower freezing levels (contours dipping below 14 kft) over the central plains, including the area affecting southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma. This confluence indicates that the level above which precipitation will transition to ice (the freezing level) is relatively low, while the air mass contains significant moisture near the surface. The presence of lower freezing levels directly supports the potential for severe hail formation mentioned in the summary, as the growth zone for ice particles within the updrafts is closer to the surface.",

A broad area of falling pressure, depicted by the transition toward blue/green contours and shading, is approaching the region encompassing southeast Kansas and northeast Oklahoma, driven by flow indicated by the wind barbs ahead of the main features. This localized surface pressure fall signature signifies convergence at the surface, which is crucial for lifting atmospheric parcels toward saturation and initiating the development of the isolated storms noted in the summary. The development of organized storm activity, including potential for large hail and damaging gusts, is supported by the convergence indicated by these rapidly falling pressure tendencies in the warm sector area.",
